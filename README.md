# Heptagon_Area_Sorting_System

## Overview

This project implements a **Verilog-based digital system** that calculates and sorts the areas of five heptagons (7-sided polygons) in real-time. The system is designed using synthesizable behavioral Verilog coding techniques and features a complete pipeline for coordinate processing, geometric calculations, and area-based sorting.

## üéØ Project Objectives

- **Calculate areas** of multiple heptagons using the Shoelace formula
- **Sort coordinates** using cross product vector analysis for consistent ordering
- **Implement bubble sort** algorithm for area-based ranking
- **Output results** sequentially with validity indicators
- **Demonstrate** advanced digital design concepts in FPGA/ASIC development

## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture

### Key Features
- **State Machine Design**: 10-state FSM controlling the entire processing pipeline
- **Vector Mathematics**: Cross product calculations for coordinate sorting
- **Geometric Processing**: Shoelace formula implementation for polygon area calculation
- **Sorting Algorithms**: Bubble sort for area ranking
- **Real-time Processing**: Pipelined architecture for continuous operation

### Processing Pipeline
1. **Data Input** (35 coordinate pairs for 5 heptagons)
2. **Coordinate Sorting** (using vector cross products)
3. **Area Calculation** (Shoelace formula implementation)
4. **Bubble Sort** (area-based ranking)
5. **Sequential Output** (sorted results with validity signals)
